    <p>Try this recipe if you want to know how to make traditional Indian gajar ka halwa, or carrot halwa. A lovely
        dessert anytime, I most recently made it for Diwali. This is the 'old school' method that uses whole milk, not
        condensed milk. You can use ghee instead of oil for initially cooking the carrots, if desired.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons sunflower seed oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds carrots, grated</li>
        <li>1.5 quarts whole milk</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>Â½ cup raisins</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons ground cardamom</li>
        <li>1 pinch saffron threads</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons chopped pistachio nuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat and add carrots. Cook and stir briefly, about 3 minutes. Pour
            in milk and increase heat; bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low
            and simmer gently, uncovered, for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Bring carrot-milk mixture back to a boil. Add sugar, raisins, cardamom, and saffron. Cook and stir until
            mixture has thickened, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Ladle carrot halwa into 8 individual serving dishes. Top each serving with 1 tablespoon pistachios. Serve
            warm or chill before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
